### Conversions required... need to convert from melt energy to energy in Watts. 


We can calculate the change in SWE in mm/day with the snow pillows, and we want to know how much energy in Watts the total daily snow melt is...

Similarly, if we have the LH flux in W/m2, we can calculate the total daily verticle water vapor in mm/day
